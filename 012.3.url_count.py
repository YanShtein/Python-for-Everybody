# Exercise 3: Use urllib to replicate the previous exercise of (1) retrieving
# the document from a URL, (2) displaying up to 3000 characters, and
# (3) counting the overall number of characters in the document. Donâ€™t
# worry about the headers for this exercise, simply show the first 3000
# characters of the document contents.
