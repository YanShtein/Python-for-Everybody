# Python-for-Everybody
Hi there,
Iam new to Python, currently learing Python specialization in Coursera, and from Dr. Charles R. Severance's book: Python for Everybody.
Here I will upload my exercises from the course.
If you find any mistakes and ways to improve my code, please write them down and huge thanks in advance :)
